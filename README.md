# OOP-coursework-enhanced-with-patterns
The coursework examines the process of refactoring the program code of a console database designed on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). The main goal is to increase the structure and maintainability of the system by applying modern concepts of software design. The work optimizes the code using the standard STL template library, UML graphical modeling, design patterns, SOLID principles and CRUD operations. This allows you to improve the modularity of the program, reduce its coupling and increase the efficiency of interaction with data. The result of the work is a structured, effective and flexible system that meets modern requirements for software development.
